## :page_facing_up: About
- This project is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns placing symbols on a 3 X 3 grid, with the goal of getting three in a row.
- Features:
```
1. Two players can play the game against each other on the same device.
2. Different messages will be diaplayed for the players
3. When getting three in a row, the color of the cells in a row will change.
4. Players can restart the game after each round.
```
- The motivation behind this project was to improve my skills in front-end web development. I wanted to challenge myself by building a game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I also enjoy playing Tic-Tac_Toe. It was a fun project to work on.

## :pencil2: Planning & Problem Solving
- To plan this project, I first wrote down some key points of the development process. I wanted to keep the design simple and intuitive, so I opted for a minimalist layout.

- Throughout the development process, I used a combination of debugging techniques and online research to solve problems and overcome challenges. Whenever I encountered an issue, I first tried to identify the root cause and isolate the problem. From there, I would search online for solutions and try out different approaches until I found one that worked.

## :rocket: Tech 
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation)

## :scream: Bugs to fix :poop:
- After resetting the game, the style should be consistent.

## :sob: Lesson learnt
- Overall, this project taught me a lot about the development process and helped me refine my problem-solving skills. I learned the importance of planning and defining clear goals before beginning a project, and I discovered new techniques and strategies for overcoming challenges along the way.

## :white_check_mark: Future features
- A better user interface with more visual feedback
- The ability to keeps track of each player's score
