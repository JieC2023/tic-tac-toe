## :page_facing_up: About
- How to play tic-tac-toe.
- Tic-tac-toe is a two-player game played on a 3 x 3 grid. Here are the steps:
```
1. One player would be "X" and the other player would then be "O";
2. The player with "X" goes first by placing an "X" in any empty cell on the grid;
3. The player with "O" goes next by placing an "O" in any empty cell on the grid;
4. Two players take turns to place their own symbol on the grid til one player gets three in a row (either in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal direction);
5. If all cells are filled without any player getting three in a row, this is a draw;
```
- Tic toac toe is a fun and easy game to play with your friends and family.

## :pencil2: Planning & Problem Solving
- Break down the steps into small pieces
- Create a basic HTML file with 3 x 3 grid
- Style the basic game board
- Work on game logic (JavaScript), keep track of game state, winning combos, use event listeners to detect when clicks happen, update the game state accordingly
- Check for win conditions, messages to the players
- reset function
- test each function during the coding process

## :rocket: Tech 
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Javascript for DOM manipulation

## :scream: Bugs to fix :poop:
- After resetting the game, the style should be consistent.

## :sob: Lesson learnt
- Starting early would allow more time to plan, execute and refine the work.
- Commit and push more often so a copy of the work at the current stage is saved
- Ask questions sooner better than later
- Create a functional product first and then make improvements over time, rather than trying to make it perfect from the outset. 

## :white_check_mark: Future features
- Get creative with the styling - research CSS effects, animations to make the game more interesting
