## :page_facing_up: About
- How to play my tic tac toe.
- Tic tac toe is a two-play game played on a 3 x 3 grid. Here are the steps:
```
$ 1. One player would be "X" and the other player would then be "O";
$ 2. The player with "X" goes first by placing an "X" in any empty cell on the grid;
$ 3. The player with "O" goes next by placing an "O" in any empty cell on the grid;
$ 4. Two players take turns to place their own symbol on the grid til one player gets three in a row (either in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal direction);
$ 5. If all cells are filled without any player getting three in a row, this is a draw;
```
- Tic toac toe is a fun and easy game to play with your friends and family.

## :sob: Lesson learnt
- Start early would give me more time to plan, execute and refine my work.
- Do a commit and push more often
- Ask questions when I was stuck sooner
- Create a functional product first and then make improvements to it over time, rather than trying to make it perfect from the outset. 

## :white_check_mark: Future features
- Get inventive with the styling - research CSS effects, animations to spiff things up
